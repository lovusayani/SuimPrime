                        We take the protection of your personal data very
                        seriously and prioritize its security using a range of

                        Despite our efforts to implement strong security

                        transmission over the internet or method of electronic
                        storage is completely secure. As such, while we are
                        committed to doing our utmost to protect your personal
                        information, we cannot guarantee absolute security. If
                        you suspect any breach or unauthorized access to your
                        account, please notify us immediately so we can take
                        appropriate action to secure your data.
